# Sensu

Playbook to install and configure Sensu.

## Requirements

Sensu does not have a strong dependency on others software (it come by default
as an omnibus). But you will need a RabbitMQ server and a Redis server. They do
not have to be on the same host as Sensu thought.

## Supported system

Currently only Debian Wheezie & Jessie amd64 are supported and tested. Patch
welcome to support other OS.

## Installation

Just use Galaxy:

    $ ansible-galaxy install Mayeu.sensu

## Semantic versioning 2.0.0

Starting with the tag
[0.1.0](https://github.com/Mayeu/ansible-playbook-sensu/tree/0.1.0),
this playbook use semantic versioning.

The public API defined in the semantic versioning correspond to the
settings available to the user. Breaking the API (incrementing from
X.Y.Z to (X+1).Y.Z) in this context mean that the user need to change
its own configuration for the playbook to run.

Any new feature added (from X.Y.Z to X.(Y+1).Z) should have a working
default value that need no user interaction by default. If a feature
addition require user interaction, then it is not a minor upgrade,
but a major one.

## Expectation

RabbitMQ is expected to be listening on its TLS port (`5671`). If your server
is setup otherwise, you'll have to change the `sensu_server_rabbitmq_port`
variable.

This also mean that you will need to have the client certificate for your
RabbitMQ server in your `files/` folder:

```
files/
 ├── sensu_client_cert.pem
 └── sensu_client_key.pem
```

Optionally RabbitMQ certificates can be retrieved from an S3 bucket. The system where Ansible runs must have authorization to access this bucket in order to use this feature. See `sensu_rabbitmq_ssl_from_s3`, `sensu_rabbitmq_ssl_s3_bucket`, and `sensu_rabbitmq_ssl_s3_path` Ansible variables for configuration.

Note that you can find a complete set of certificates and keys in
`vagrant/files/` for **test purpose only**. Be smart, don't use certificates &
keys publicly available in production! You can also customize this path, see
[Roles Variables](#roles-variables).

The playbook also expect that you have the following folder organisation for
Sensu script in your `files/` folder:

```
files/
 └── sensu/
     ├── plugins/
     ├── handlers/
     └── extensions/
```

This follow the organisation of the Sensu community plugins repository.

## Configuration organisation

The configuration of Sensu does not uses the `/etc/sensu/config.json` file
anymore, but split all the files in the `/etc/sensu/conf.d` folder:

```
/etc/sensu
└── conf.d
    ├── api.json
    ├── checks.json
    ├── client.json
    ├── handlers.json
    ├── filters.json
    ├── rabbitmq.json
    ├── redis.json
    └── settings.json
```

All those files are created from a template, that use the variable you'll setup
for your playbook. See [Role Variables](#role-variables).

If you have custom key/value you want to add to your client configuration,
please uses the `sensu_settings` variable, that will generate the
`settings.json` file.

## Gem dependencies

Some plugins depend on installed gems. Required gems can be installed via Sensu's embedded `gem` binary using the `sensu_gems` variable. The variable expects a list of hashes each with a gem `name` and `version` string key.

## Dependencies

Weak dependencies on:

* Redis
* RabbitMQ

## Tests

There is some really basic tests with the playbook. It just try to install a
server with client, a server only, and a client only, on 3 VM:

    $ vagrant up

The test depends on the following roles (that are already present in the
`vagrant/roles` folder):

* Mayeu.RabbitMQ
* redis
